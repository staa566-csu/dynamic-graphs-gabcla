Make a dynamic figure. Describe the following:

 - data source
 - what you want to convey in the figure
 - what functionality and formatting you put into the figure and why
 
Update the code and final figure to GitHub. Make sure the code is functional on GitHub. Make sure your work can be replicated including pulling the data. If the work cannot be replicated give a short note explaining why (so we know you didnâ€™t just skip this part).

You can make one html file in your repo that has your figure and your figure discussion.
